# Lisp Practice with Paradigms Of AI Programming

This is a repo of all the exercises done from the textbook "Paradigms Of Artificial Intelligence Programming".

This is a bit of a personal endeavor, I've been reading so much about the elegance of Lisp and its place in programming history that I thought I might as well try writing in it.

I don't see this repo being anything more than an exploratory project.

The author of the book hosts a fantastic repo containing real code as well, linked [here](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp), this adds nothing except the fact that it acts as a record of my attempts to learning this language and using it to solve problems.
